# bashPID

This script implements a PID controller using bash and bc
The sensor I used is k10temp and the output is the pwms on my it8728, using the IT87 module.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
This is my first program with any real use, so if anyone has ways of improving the script and helping me learn, feel free to make this better!
